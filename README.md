### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Chaedar (he/him), a master's student in Public Administration at Columbia University. My study focuses on energy and the environment,
with a specialization in data analytics and quantitative analysis.

I am currently learning how to analyze text data especially from online resources, such as social media and news. I realized that text data 
is the new number, and there have been some techniques and tools developed to harness this resource to gain insights previously not seen 
using conventional approach.

With an engineering background, I am quite comfortable with math and the idea of programming. Yet, I do not have sufficient experience in
working on programming projects, and I believe joining a community in github would help me to learn the best practice in text analysis 
using any programming language.

My recent hobby is hiking in the US national parks. I have visited 15 national parks during the last 6 months, including Yosemite, Yellowstone,
Grand Teton, Rocky Mountains, and many more. They are all gorgeous! I am looking to have another trip to Glacier National Park thins spring,
and several national parks in Alaska during this early summer.

You can reach me through my email (cip2121@columbia.edu). Looking forward to connecting and collaborating with you!
